    "question": "What are the common diseases that affect tea plants?",
    "answer": "Common tea plant diseases include blister blight (Exobasidium vexans), root rot (Armillaria mellea), brown root rot (Phellinus noxius), and red rust (Cephaleuros parasiticus). Blister blight affects young leaves and stems, while root diseases can kill entire bushes. Regular monitoring and proper fungicide application are essential for disease management.",

    "question": "How often should tea plants be fertilized?",
    "answer": "Tea plants should be fertilized 3-4 times per year, typically during the growing season. Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers after pruning, before the first flush, and during peak growing periods. The recommended NPK ratio is approximately 20:10:10 or 15:15:15, with nitrogen being the most critical nutrient for tea growth.",

    "answer": "The best time to harvest tea leaves is during the early morning hours (6-10 AM) when the leaves are fresh and contain optimal levels of essential oils. Harvest the two leaves and a bud (TAB) - the top two tender leaves and the unopened bud. The first flush (spring harvest) typically produces the highest quality tea.",

    "answer": "Tea plants thrive in acidic soil with a pH range of 4.5 to 5.5. Soil pH below 4.0 or above 6.0 can negatively affect tea growth and quality. Regular soil testing and application of sulfur or lime (depending on pH) helps maintain optimal conditions. Well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter is ideal.",

    "answer": "Tea bushes should be pruned every 3-5 years, depending on the variety and growth rate. Light pruning (skiffing) is done annually to maintain the plucking table, while medium pruning removes 10-15 cm of growth every 2-3 years. Heavy pruning (cutting back to 30-45 cm) is done every 4-5 years to rejuvenate the bush.",
